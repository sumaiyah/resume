# A LaTeX resume template

*I have adapted the original class files from [Trey Hunner](https://github.com/treyhunner/resume) and design to something that i quite like now :)*

`resume.cls` is a document class that adds name and address information to the
head of the document and provides resume section and subsection environments
(`rSection` and `rSubsection`).  The address separator format, the
`rSubsection` heading format, and the skip sizes defined in `resume.cls` can be
customized.
